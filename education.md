[^1]: ME 317 is a course I took while studying abroad at the London School of Economics and Political Science.

[^2]: I also earned my 12th associate degree here—in [anthropology](https://www.parchment.com/u/award/c7daeb8936ad05b0d087c9b09669e0ae), because who says you can’t study ancient civilizations while coding?
