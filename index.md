Since discovering how machine learning 🤖 can transform financial systems 💰, I’ve been on a mission to merge data science with fintech. As an engineer and mentor, I build intelligent systems that solve complex problems, blending creativity and guidance to make intricate ideas accessible and impactful. I’m studying part-time as a graduate student at Stanford University 🎓 to deepen my knowledge of computer science and stay current with new developments.

My educational journey has been a coast-to-coast adventure—and even crossed the Atlantic 🌍. After completing my studies at the University of California, Berkeley 🐻, I broadened my global perspective by studying abroad at the London School of Economics and Political Science 🇬🇧. Eager to deepen my expertise in data-driven technologies, I earned a Graduate Certificate in Data Science from Harvard Extension School 🎓 in 2021.

As a proud first-generation 🌱, low-income (FLI) college graduate, my story is deeply rooted in resilience and aspiration. Over 30 years ago, my parents fled Vietnam 🇻🇳 as war refugees, seeking a new beginning in the United States. The courage they’ve shown on their journey continues to inspire me to push boundaries and strive for excellence in all that I do.

When I’m not delving into algorithms or teaching, you can find me exploring the rich world of espresso ☕. My favorite spot for coffee beans is [Andytown Coffee Roasters](https://www.andytownsf.com/). Also love powerlifting 🏋️‍♂️ and playing catch ⚾.
