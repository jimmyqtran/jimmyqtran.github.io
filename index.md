Ever since I discovered how machine learning can transform financial systems, I've been on a mission to merge data science with fintech. As both an engineer and an educator, I thrive on making complex concepts accessible and impactful. Pursuing my passion further, I'm a part-time graduate student at Stanford University, exploring the frontiers of computer science to stay at the forefront of innovation.

My educational path has been a coast-to-coast adventureâ€”and even crossed the Atlantic. Beginning community college courses while still in middle school, I cultivated a wide range of interests that led to earning 12 associate degrees. This foundation paved the way for immersing myself in statistics and economics at the University of California, Berkeley, and expanding my global perspective by studying abroad at the London School of Economics and Political Science. Eager to deepen my expertise in data-driven technologies, I completed a Graduate Certificate in Data Science at Harvard Extension School in 2021.

As a proud first-generation, low-income (FLI) college graduate, my story is deeply rooted in resilience and aspiration. Over 30 years ago, my parents fled Vietnam as war refugees, seeking a new beginning in the United States. The courage they've shown on their journey continues to inspire me to push boundaries and strive for excellence in all that I do.

When I'm not delving into algorithms or teaching, you can find me exploring the rich world of espresso. My favorite spot for coffee beans is [Andytown Coffee Roasters](https://www.andytownsf.com/).
