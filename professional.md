## Projects

#### Data Fellow/Data Scientist
**Delta Analytics & CareerVillage.org**  — San Francisco, CA  
*2021*  
Our team at Delta Analytics partnered with CareerVillage.org to enhance the platform’s ability to match students’ career-related questions with professionals, focusing on improving the relevance of email recommendations. Using insights from the occupation dataset we developed in 2020, we analyzed user trends and evaluated the existing recommendation algorithms. Our findings revealed a need for improvements in matching accuracy, and we proposed enhancements using a bag-of-words model. Additionally, we developed comprehensive unit tests to help CareerVillage improve their algorithm’s effectiveness. Our work provided actionable insights and recommendations that CareerVillage prioritized for further implementation.
